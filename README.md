# Hi, I'm Fraylin AyalaðŸ‘‹

"Itâ€™s remarkable what you can build if you just donâ€™t stop. Itâ€™s remarkable the business you can build if you donâ€™t stop working. Itâ€™s remarkable the body you can build if you donâ€™t stop training. Itâ€™s remarkable the knowledge you can build if you donâ€™t stop learning" - James Clear

I'm a first-generation Hispanic college student passionate about developing technologies and tools that help people accomplish their goals and facilitate their day-to-day work. I am a competitive person who loves being challenged and enjoys solving complex problems.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I am working on a Workout Routine App (React, MongoDB, Node.js) that allows users to create their own workout routine by browsing a collection of exercises and selecting the exercises they would like to incorporate into their workout regimen. The app will allow users to see the proper form to do the exercise as well as read fitness-related articles.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my React and MongoDB skills. I am also exploring cloud computing and machine learning.
